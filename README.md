# Age Detection using Fine-Tuned CNN (VGGFace)  

This project demonstrates the fine-tuning of a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically **VGGFace**, to perform age detection on the **IMDB-WIKI** dataset.  

## Features  
- Leverages transfer learning to adapt VGGFace for age detection tasks.  
- Prepares the IMDB-WIKI dataset for effective training and testing.  
- Focuses on functionality and accuracy without the use of a GUI.  
- Implements custom layers for model optimization.
